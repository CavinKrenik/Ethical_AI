                        evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence within educational settings. AI is no longer a
                        futuristic concept; it's actively shaping how students learn, how educators teach, and how
                        academic integrity is perceived. We'll delve into the incredible potential AI offers to enhance
                        learning experiences, alongside the critical challenges and ethical questions it poses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we navigate this complex terrain, it's essential to engage in thoughtful discussions about
                        the implications of AI in education. This site serves as a resource for students, educators, and
