          <h2>Prompt Engineering Secrets</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Give ChatGPT a role:</strong>
              <br>
              Assign the AI an identity or job title to prime it for more confident, structured, and relevant
              responses.<br>
              <em>Instead of:</em> “Tell me about marketing.”<br>
              <em>Try:</em> “You are a world-class marketing strategist. What are three clever ways a small business
              could grow on TikTok?”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Think step-by-step:</strong>
              <br>
              Use chain-of-thought prompting for multi-step tasks or logic puzzles.<br>
              <em>Instead of:</em> “What’s the answer to this math problem?”<br>
              <em>Try:</em> “Let’s solve this step by step.”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Set clear constraints:</strong>
              <br>
              Add rules and context to keep the model focused.<br>
              <em>Instead of:</em> “I need three subject lines for a Mother’s Day sale”<br>
              <em>Try:</em> “Give me three subject lines for a Mother’s Day sale — keep them under 50 characters and use
              playful language.”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Break big tasks into smaller prompts:</strong>
              <br>
              Guide the AI step by step for more control and accuracy.<br>
              <em>Example:</em>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>“Summarize this blog post.”</li>
                <li>“Now rewrite that summary in a more casual tone.”</li>
                <li>“Now turn it into an Instagram caption.”</li>
              </ol>

            <li>
              <strong>Show examples:</strong>
              <br>
              Give the model a sample tone or structure to mimic.<br>
              <em>Example:</em> “Write a product description like this one: ‘These boots are made for adventure. Built
              tough, but cozy enough for your lazy Sunday scrolls.’ Now write one for a travel backpack.”
            </li>

              <strong>Don’t be afraid to iterate:</strong>
              <br>
              Treat prompting like debugging code. Adjust and rerun until you get what you want.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tell the chatbot how you want it to sound:</strong>
              <br>
              Specify the tone or style you want—warm, funny, professional, flirty, etc.<br>
              <em>Instead of:</em> “Write a thank-you note.”<br>
              <em>Try:</em> “Write a thank-you note that’s warm and funny, like something you’d text a close friend.”

      <!-- Section: The 3-Word Rule for prompts -->
      <section class="transparent-box" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h2>The “3-Word Rule” for Expert-Level Responses</h2>
        <p>
          Add three words, get better results. The “3-word rule” is a simple tweak that can take your chatbot from
          surface-level answers to something that feels custom, thoughtful, and expert-level.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the 3-word rule?</h3>
        <p>
          Just add a short, three-word directive to your prompt that tells ChatGPT how to respond. These three words
          instantly shape the tone, voice, and depth of the output.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Like a lawyer”</strong> — for structured, detailed, and logical responses</li>
          <li><strong>“Be a teacher”</strong> — for simplified, clear, and educational explanations</li>
          <li><strong>“Act like Hemingway”</strong> — for punchy, minimalist writing with impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This works because ChatGPT has been trained on a massive variety of writing styles and professional voices.
          When you give it a short cue—like “like a professor”—it taps into that persona and shifts its tone
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Starter ideas:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“Summarize this article like a journalist”</li>
          <li>“Explain dark matter like a professor”</li>
          <li>“Give feedback like a mentor”</li>
          <li>“Write a poem like a songwriter”</li>
          <li>“Translate this message like a diplomat”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can swap in almost any role or voice that fits your needs: CEO, therapist, designer, coach, teenager, or
          just about anyone else. The more specific, the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 3-word rule isn’t magic, but it’s close. It’s one of the easiest ways to upgrade your prompts and get
          smarter, more human-like responses from AI.

      <!-- Section: The Surprising Power of Politeness in Prompting AI -->
      <section class="transparent-box" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h2>The Surprising Power of Politeness in Prompting AI</h2>
        <!-- Functional columns for politeness tips -->
        <div class="tips-grid">
          <!-- Left column: Intro and first three points -->
          <div class="tips-col">
            <p>
              When it comes to interacting with artificial intelligence, most people focus on the technical
              aspects—being specific, adding context, or using structured formats. But there’s another, often-overlooked
              technique that can make your AI conversations smoother, more helpful, and even more humanlike: basic
              politeness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, you read that right. Saying “please” and “thank you” to an AI might seem unnecessary—after all, it’s
              not conscious or emotionally aware. But in many cases, those simple words can actually improve the quality
              of the responses you get. Here’s why.
            </p>
            <!-- 1. Politeness Guides Tone -->
            <h3>1. Politeness Guides Tone</h3>
            <p>
              AI language models are trained on massive amounts of text data, including conversations, articles,
              instructions, and human interactions. When you say “please,” the AI picks up on that as a signal for a
              certain tone—typically more helpful, less aggressive, and more service-oriented.
            </p>
            <div class="example-row">
              <strong>Without politeness:</strong> “Summarize this article.”<br>
              <strong>With politeness:</strong> “Could you please summarize this article for me?”
            </div>
            <p>
              The second version doesn’t just sound better—it often gets you a more thorough and friendlier response.
              Why? Because you’re signaling that you want a helpful, service-minded reply, and the AI picks up on that
              nuance.
            </p>
            <!-- 2. Thank You Signals Completion -->
            <h3>2. “Thank You” Signals Completion and Gratitude</h3>
            <p>
              While AI doesn’t feel appreciated, saying “thank you” helps signal the end of a task or query. This can
              subtly affect follow-up responses, encouraging the AI to stay within the same polite tone or avoid
              redundant explanations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even better, saying “thank you” models good behavior for any audience reading the exchange. In classrooms,
              client interactions, or team environments, it reinforces digital etiquette and mutual respect—even when
              the other party is artificial.
            </p>
            <!-- 3. Politeness = Better Role Simulation -->
            <h3>3. Politeness = Better Role Simulation</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re using role prompting (e.g., “Act like a friendly tutor”), politeness naturally supports the tone
              you want. A polite user often gets a polite AI—like a mirror reflecting your attitude.
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- Right column: Remaining points and final thoughts -->
          <div class="tips-col">
            <p>
              When users get abrupt or overly dry answers from AI, it’s often because the prompt was just as blunt. Try
              using polite phrasing and see how much more “human” the chatbot starts to sound.
            </p>
            <!-- 4. Low Effort, High Reward -->
            <h3>4. It’s Low Effort, High Reward</h3>
            <p>
              Adding a “please” or “thank you” costs you nothing—but it can subtly steer the AI toward better responses.
              In some cases, it can even help the model disambiguate your intent or handle your request more gracefully.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also helps when working with long prompts or complex instructions. A sentence like “Please rewrite this
              paragraph with a more confident tone” sounds clearer—and yields better results—than “Rewrite this
              paragraph confident.”
            </p>
            <!-- 5. You Set the Cultural Tone -->
            <h3>5. You Set the Cultural Tone</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re using AI in a shared space—like a classroom, business, or collaborative project—your tone
              matters. By modeling politeness, you help establish a culture where respectful, constructive interaction
              is the norm—even with machines.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s especially important for younger users, who are learning how to navigate digital environments and
              build healthy tech habits. Saying “please” to AI might not change the machine—but it definitely shapes the
              human.
            </p>
            <!-- Final thoughts on politeness -->
            <div class="final-thoughts">
              <h3>More Than Just Manners</h3>
              <p>
                Saying “please” and “thank you” to an AI isn’t about tricking the system—it’s about communicating with
                intention. These words give your prompt tone, clarity, and direction. They help you shape not just what
                the AI says, but how it says it.
              </p>
              <p>
                And who knows? As AI gets more embedded into our daily lives, the habit of being polite to our digital
                assistants might just make our human conversations a little kinder too.

        <p>
          Prompt engineering is not magic; it's thoughtful communication. The better your input, the better the output.
          And with tools like ChatGPT getting smarter by the day, learning how to “talk AI” might just be the new
          digital literacy that makes the chatbot work even better for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give these techniques a try next time you fire up ChatGPT and you might be surprised by what it can do!
